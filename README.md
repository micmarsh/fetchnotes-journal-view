# Fetchnotes Journal Viewer

## Background 
Back in the day, I used to journal in Fetchnotes and tagged notes by `"#<month><day>"`, such as `"#may23"`, `"#jul4"`, or `"#dec18"`. 

Given an exported set of notes (mine), I can use this script to read them in chronological order

## Dependencies
Currently uses global installations of `aeson` and `lens`, b/c cabal is scary and I didn't feel like learning how to make a cabal file just yet.

## Usage
Clone it, run it. You'll need a file `"notes.json"` in the same directory.
